Fun fact: the rules of a board game are not protected intellectual property. As
long as you don't:

- copy a particular written account of the rules,
- any graphics or branding content from the original game,
- violate the trademark by creating something that could reasonably be mistaken
  for the original,

I believe it's not a violation. If you believe otherwise, I'm definitely
interested in hearing about it.

Realistically though, I wrote this so I could play with my friends, after
discovering the otherwise-excellent isc.ro didn't seem to support more than two
players. I'm unlikely to make a major commercial enterprise out of it.
